Main Class: The Main class contains the main method, which is the entry point of the program.

Creating Objects: Objects of the Dog and Cat classes are created with names "Buddy" and "Whiskers", respectively.

Testing Methods: The methods makeSound(), eat(), move(), and sleep() are called on the dog and cat objects to test their implementations.

This code demonstrates the use of an interface, an abstract class, and concrete classes in Java. It shows how to define and implement methods in each type and how to test the implementation by creating objects and calling the necessary methods.# School
